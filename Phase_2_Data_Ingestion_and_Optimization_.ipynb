Obviously its not a problem with the hotel, also  the unconscious people that stay are some are drunk people arriving after hrs being... trashy, making noise & smoking pot in the middle of the hall.  Laughing  & still partying. That really makes it unpleasant. I called the receptionist to send the security guard to stop that, they did it in no time. So Id suggests the hotel should be watching all these people that comes in at night & ask them to be quiet all the way to their room. <br/>Other than that its fine.

Jenna was a great host. She was responsive and helpful. The apartment is very clean, newly furnished, and tastefully designed. It had everything for basic cleaning and cooking. Good bedding, towels and cozy blankets for the living room. There’s a TV that you can roll into the rooms or living room with all streaming services available. The laundry machine is right out the back kitchen door, easy to operate, and always available. In our two months there, we never saw anyone else using it. The apartment is in the best location off Union St. The neighborhood is very cute and safe. So many great restaurants and cafes nearby! The 45 and 22 buses stop right by the apartment which is convenient. The rooftop was an awesome space with the most incredible view of the city and the Golden Gate Bridge!

Now improvements… I wish they had room service and parking wasn’t so expensive ($80 for valet parking). There is a garage behind the hotel that charges $35 per day but the gate was broken most of my stay so it was hell trying to get out of the garage. I had to call for help every time. As for food they have a market but it doesn’t carry full meals for instance if you wanted breakfast delivered to your room. That was a bummer.

It was a stunning location to focus on growing our business while also enjoying some relaxing time together as a team. Leanne was responsive and incredibly helpful. She went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The home is beautiful and with ensuite bathrooms we weren't stepping over each other.  We loved the decor, the creative + relaxing vibe, and how clean and fresh everything was. We enjoyed all of the unique spaces including AM Yoga on the Roof as well as a Chef prepared dinner made in the gourmet kitchen!  The the rooms were sizable, the beds were super comfortable,  and the natural light was incredible. Lastly, the rooftop is beyond fun for impromptu activities and inspired deep connections and conversations with the large table and lounge furniture. We'll look forward to staying again!\", 1.0)\n",

The only downsides were it was a bit loud at night, being close to union square so it wasn’t shocking but important to mention.
