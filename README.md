# Company Background
Airbnb is a global leader in short-term vacation rentals, providing a platform that connects hosts and travelers across the world. As the platform continues to grow, the need for robust data solutions becomes increasingly important to optimize internal operations and provide valuable business insights.

# Project Overview
Airbnb is seeking a data engineering contractor to transform raw Airbnb datasets into actionable insights, driving business optimization and revenue growth. The goal is to build a comprehensive data engineering platform to process, ingest, transform, and analyze complex datasets efficiently, while supporting both batch and real-time data pipelines. The project spans a year, simulating the journey of a data engineer working with Airbnb data.

# Project Goals

    * Build scalable data pipelines for batch and real-time data ingestion.
    * Implement advanced data transformation and machine learning models.
    * Design a cloud-based data warehouse for business intelligence reporting.
    * Develop interactive dashboards to deliver business insights.

# Project Scope

# Data Cleaning and Augmentation (Months 1-3) Data Profiling and Cleaning: 
   Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnbâ€™s calendar.csv, listings.csv, and reviews.csv datasets. Identify and visualize quality issues such as missing values, outliers, and anomalies. Implement data 
   cleaning strategies using methods such as imputation and outlier correction.
# Data Augmentation and Synthesis: 
   Develop techniques to augment the dataset by creating synthetic data, predicting missing values using machine learning models, and validating the augmented data with statistical methods.
# Data Integration:
   Integrate the three datasets into a consolidated and optimized format, resolving inconsistencies and redundancies.
    
# Data Pipeline Development (Months 4-6)

# Scalable Data Ingestion Pipeline:
   Design and implement a scalable data ingestion pipeline using Python, Pandas, and SQL. Ensure it handles both batch and real-time data, includes error handling, logging, and monitoring features.
# Advanced Storage Optimization: 
   Implement storage optimization techniques such as partitioning, indexing, and compression, and evaluate the performance impact on data retrieval and storage efficiency in cloud-based storage solutions (AWS  
   RDS, Google BigQuery).
# Data Lake Architecture: 
   Design and implement a data lake architecture using tools like Apache Hadoop or Amazon S3, ensuring it meets data governance, security, and compliance standards.
   
# Data Transformation and Insights (Months 7-9)

# Data Transformation Workflows: 
   Design scalable data transformation workflows using tools like Apache Spark or Apache Airflow. Perform transformations including aggregation, filtering, and enrichment to derive meaningful insights.
# Feature Engineering for Machine Learning:
   Develop feature engineering techniques using domain knowledge to create new features from raw data that enhance machine learning model performance.
# Data Normalization and Encoding: 
   Implement data normalization and encoding methods like one-hot encoding, label encoding, and embeddings for categorical variables. Validate the impact of these techniques on machine learning models.
   
# Data Warehousing and Visualization (Months 10-12)
# Enterprise Data Warehousing: 
   Design an enterprise-level data warehouse schema using cloud-based solutions like Amazon Redshift or Google BigQuery. Implement ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to populate the data warehouse.
# Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning Models:
   Develop machine learning models using regression, classification, and clustering techniques to derive business insights, such as predicting demand or identifying trends. Evaluate and iteratively improve  model 
   performance.
# Advanced Business Intelligence Reporting: 
   Develop interactive business intelligence dashboards using Power BI or Tableau. Focus on dynamic visualizations for key business metrics and provide actionable recommendations based on data analysis.

# Deliverables

    Monthly Progress Reports: Detailed reports outlining progress on each problem statement, including methodologies, challenges, and preliminary results.
    Final Data Warehouse: A fully populated and optimized data warehouse schema.
    Predictive Models: Trained and validated machine learning models with performance metrics.
    BI Dashboards: Interactive dashboards for exploring data and insights.
    Comprehensive Final Report: A detailed report summarizing the entire project, including methodologies, findings, and recommendations
